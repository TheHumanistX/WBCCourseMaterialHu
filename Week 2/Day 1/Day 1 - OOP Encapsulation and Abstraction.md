## Lesson Objectives
Welcome to the lesson on Encapsulation and Abstraction. In our previous lesson, we introduced you to the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming and the four pillars of OOP: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Today, we will delve deeper into two of those principles--encapsulation and abstraction--and learn how to implement them effectively in Python classes.

The objectives of this lesson are to:
* Understand the concepts of encapsulation and abstraction in Python OOP.
* Learn how to implement encapsulation and abstraction in Python classes.
* Apply encapsulation and abstraction principles in a simple Python project.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a strong grasp of encapsulation and abstraction principles and be able to incorporate them into your Python projects to create cleaner, more efficient, and maintainable code.

## Introduction

### Encapsulation and Abstraction in Python OOP

Encapsulation and abstraction are two fundamental principles in object-oriented programming that help us create clean, organized, and efficient code. They promote modularity and separation of concerns, making it easier to understand, maintain, and expand our programs.

Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data within a single unit called a class. This allows us to hide the implementation details of a class from the outside world, protecting the data from unintended modifications and providing a clear interface for interacting with the class.

Abstraction, on the other hand, focuses on simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. It provides a high-level interface for interacting with a class, hiding the underlying complexity and implementation details. Abstraction ensures that a class only exposes what is necessary for the outside world to interact with it, while keeping the inner workings hidden.

Together, encapsulation and abstraction make it easier to design and maintain large-scale applications, as well as promote code reuse and modular programming.

In this lesson, we will explore the concepts of encapsulation and abstraction in Python, learn how to implement them in classes, and apply them in a simple project. Let's begin by discussing encapsulation in more detail.

## Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of hiding data or information within a class to prevent outside access or modification. In Python, encapsulation is achieved through the use of private and public attributes.

Public attributes are accessible from outside the class and can be accessed and modified freely. On the other hand, private attributes are only accessible from within the class itself and cannot be accessed or modified directly from outside the class.

To define private attributes in Python, we use the double underscore prefix (__). For example, if we define a private attribute __password, this attribute can only be accessed and modified from within the class.

Here is an example of encapsulation in Python:

    class User:
        def __init__(self, username, password):
            self.username = username
            self.__password = password

        def login(self, username, password):
            if self.username == username and self.__password == password:
                print("Login successful!")
            else:
                print("Login failed. Incorrect username or password.")

In this example, we have defined a User class that has two attributes, username and `__password`. The `__password` attribute is private and can only be accessed from within the `User` class.

We have also defined a login method that takes a username and password as input and checks if they match the username and `__password` attributes of the `User` object. If the login is successful, the method prints `"Login successful!"` otherwise it prints `"Login failed. Incorrect username or password."`

Encapsulation provides several benefits, including data security, code organization, and ease of maintenance. By hiding data within a class, we can prevent unwanted access or modification from outside the class and ensure that our code is more secure.

Now that we have covered encapsulation, let's move on to discussing abstraction.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details while emphasizing essential features. In Python, abstraction is typically achieved through the use of public and private methods.

Public methods are accessible from outside the class and can be used to access or modify the internal state of the object. Private methods are only accessible from within the class itself and are used to perform internal operations that are not relevant to the outside world.

To define private methods in Python, we use the double underscore prefix (__). For example, if we define a private method `__calculate_tax`, this method can only be accessed and called from within the class.

Here is an example of abstraction in Python:

    class BankAccount:
        def __init__(self, balance):
            self.__balance = balance

        def deposit(self, amount):
            self.__balance += amount
            print("Deposit successful. New balance:", self.__balance)

        def withdraw(self, amount):
            if amount > self.__balance:
                print("Withdrawal failed. Insufficient funds.")
            else:
                self.__balance -= amount
                print("Withdrawal successful. New balance:", self.__balance)

        def __calculate_interest(self):
            interest_rate = 0.05
            interest = self.__balance * interest_rate
            self.__balance += interest

        def add_interest(self):
            self.__calculate_interest()
            print("Interest added. New balance:", self.__balance)

In this example, we have defined a BankAccount class that has a private attribute `__balance` and four methods: `deposit`, `withdraw`, `add_interest`, and `__calculate_interest`. The `deposit` and `withdraw` methods are public and can be called from outside the class to modify the `__balance` attribute. The `add_interest` method is also public and is used to add interest to the account balance.

The `__calculate_interest` method is private and can only be accessed from within the `BankAccount` class. This method calculates the interest on the account balance and updates the `__balance` attribute accordingly. The `add_interest` method calls the `__calculate_interest` method to add interest to the account balance.

Abstraction provides several benefits, including code simplicity, modularity, and ease of maintenance. By hiding unnecessary details and providing a simple interface to the outside world, we can create code that is easier to understand and maintain.

Now that we have covered abstraction, let's move on to discussing how to apply encapsulation and abstraction principles in a simple Python project.

## Applying Encapsulation and Abstraction
For this project, let's imagine that we are building a simple game where the player can create and manage their own character. We want to use encapsulation and abstraction principles to ensure that the player's character data is secure and that the game code is easy to understand and maintain.

Here is an example implementation of the game using encapsulation and abstraction:

    class Character:
        def __init__(self, name, health, strength):
            self.__name = name
            self.__health = health
            self.__strength = strength

        def get_name(self):
            return self.__name

        def get_health(self):
            return self.__health

        def get_strength(self):
            return self.__strength

        def set_health(self, health):
            self.__health = health

        def set_strength(self, strength):
            self.__strength = strength


    class Game:
        def __init__(self):
            self.__player_character = None

        def create_character(self, name, health, strength):
            self.__player_character = Character(name, health, strength)

        def get_character_health(self):
            return self.__player_character.get_health()

        def set_character_health(self, health):
            self.__player_character.set_health(health)

        def get_character_strength(self):
            return self.__player_character.get_strength()

        def set_character_strength(self, strength):
            self.__player_character.set_strength(strength)

In this implementation, we have defined two classes, `Character` and `Game`. The `Character` class represents the player's character and has private attributes `__name`, `__health`, and `__strength`. We have defined public getter and setter methods for the health and strength attributes, allowing us to access and modify these attributes in a controlled manner.

The `Game` class represents the game itself and has a private attribute `__player_character`, which is an instance of the `Character` class representing the player's character. We have defined public getter and setter methods for the health and strength attributes of the player's character, allowing us to manage the character's data in a secure and controlled manner.

This implementation ensures that the player's character data is secure, as the private attributes can only be accessed and modified through the getter and setter methods. It also ensures that the game code is easy to understand and maintain, as the `Character` class and its methods encapsulate the details of the character data and the `Game` class and its methods abstract away the details of the game mechanics.

To apply these principles in a real-world project, you would need to think carefully about the design of your classes and the data they represent, and carefully consider which attributes and methods should be private and which should be public. By using encapsulation and abstraction principles, you can create code that is secure, modular, and easy to maintain.

## Lesson Summary
Great, let's now summarize what we have covered in this lesson on Python OOP encapsulation and abstraction.
