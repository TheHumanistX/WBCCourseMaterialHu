    Discord server for student interaction

Lesson Outline:

    Introduction (3 minutes)
        Introduce the topic of applying inheritance and polymorphism in Python OOP
        Briefly explain the structure of the lesson

    Implementing Inheritance (15 minutes)
        Walk through the process of creating a base class in Python
        Show how to create subclasses that inherit from the base class
        Demonstrate how to override methods in subclasses
        Provide examples of implementing inheritance in Python code

    Implementing Polymorphism (15 minutes)
        Explain the process of implementing method overloading in Python
        Demonstrate how to override methods for polymorphism
        Explore the concept of duck typing with examples in Python code
        Provide examples of implementing polymorphism in Python code

    Building a Simple Project (20 minutes)
        Introduce a simple project that utilizes both inheritance and polymorphism
        Walk students through the process of building the project step by step
        Encourage students to follow along and create their own example project, implementing inheritance and polymorphism

    Wrap-up and next steps (5 minutes)
        Summarize the key points from the lesson
        Explain how students can ask questions and get support through the Discord server
        Preview the next lesson, which will focus on error handling in Python OOP

    Q&A (2 minutes)
        Remind students to ask questions in the Discord server, where instructors and peers can provide support
        Encourage students to help each other by answering questions and sharing resources
