## Day 1:
### Programming Fundamentals: Intro to Object Oriented Programming
* The importance of Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
  * OOP in various development fields
  * Benefits of using OOP
  * Comparing OOP to procedural programming
* Four pillars of OOP
  * Encapsulation
  * Abstraction
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism

### Python OOP: Encapsulation and Abstraction
* Encapsulation
  * Concept of data hiding
  * Private and public attributes
  * Protecting data from unintended modification
* Abstraction
  * Simplifying complex systems
  * Setter/getter (accessor/mutator) methods
  * Public and private methods
* Applying Encapsulation and Abstraction
  * Creating a class with encapsulation in mind
  * Implementing abstraction through public methods
  * Building a simple project using encapsulation and abstraction principles

### Project: Game Base Classes
* Creating base classes for game components
  * Character
  * Item
  * Scene
* Applying Encapsulation to base classes
* Applying Abstraction to base classes



## Day 2:
### Python OOP: Inheritance and Polymorphism
* Inheritance
  * Concept of code reuse
  * Types of Inheritance
    * Single Inheritance
    * Multiple Inheritance
    * Multilevel Inheritance
  * The super() function
* Polymorphism
  * Flexibility and reusability in code
  * Method Overloading
  * Method Overriding
  * Duck Typing

### Python OOP: Applying Inheritance and Polymorphism
* Implementing Inheritance
  * Creating a base class
  * Creating subclasses and inheriting from the base class
  * Overriding methods in subclasses
* Implementing Polymorphism
  * Demonstrating method overloading
  * Demonstrating method overriding
  * Exploring duck typing with examples
* Building a simple project using inheritance and polymorphism principles

### Project: Game Sub-Classes Part 1
* Creating component sub-classes
  * Character:
    * Player sub-class
    * EnemyNPC sub-class
	* BossNPC sub-class
  * Scene: `Connected by graph data structure`
	* Hallway `Connects Rooms, has random EnemyNPC spawn chance`
	* Room `Connected Hallway, can have random EnemyNPC spawn chance, or have determined BossNPC` 
    * LockedDoor `Allows passage if player holds correct key`
* Applying OOP to sub-classes


## Day 3:
### Python OOP: Error Handling
* Error Handling
  * Understanding exceptions
  * The try, except, else, and finally blocks
  * Catching multiple exceptions
* Implementing Error Handling
  * Writing code with proper exception handling
  * Catching specific exceptions
  * Utilizing else and finally blocks
* Building a simple project using error handling

### Project: Game Sub-Classes Part 2
* Creating component sub-classes
  * Item: `Includes non-consumable and consumable items`
    * Weapon sub-class
    * Armor sub-class
    * Shield sub-class
    * HealthPotion sub-class
* Applying OOP to sub-classes


## Day 4:
### Python OOP: Game Project
* Project Overview
  * Introduction to the game project
  * Requirements and objectives
  * Planning the project structure
* Implementing OOP Principles
  * Applying encapsulation and abstraction
  * Utilizing inheritance and polymorphism
  * Handling errors and using custom exceptions

### Project: Game Sub-Classes Part 3
* Creating component sub-classes
  * Scene: `Connected by graph data structure`
	* Hallway `Connects Rooms, has random EnemyNPC spawn chance`
	* Room `Connected Hallway, can have random EnemyNPC spawn chance, or have determined BossNPC` 
    * LockedDoor `Allows passage if player holds correct key`
* Applying OOP to sub-classes


## Day 5:
### Python OOP: Finishing and Reviewing the Game Project
* Building the Game
  * Developing the game step by step
  * Implementing game logic and components
  * Applying OOP principles throughout the project
* Reviewing and Refining the Game
  * Testing the game for functionality
  * Identifying and fixing potential issues
  * Discussing possible improvements and future features
