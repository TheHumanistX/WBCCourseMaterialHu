**Note:** This syllabus is a loose overview, and may be subject to change should certain subjects prove too challenging or simple. If any weeks need to have content added or removed to level out the time spent each day, then we will do so. Also, the days when topics are discussed are estimations and will be narrowed down and shifted around as they are produced. Our goal is to even out the daily content to around 2 hours of lesson time coupled with 2 hours of practice time, for a total of 4 hours daily, 20 hours weekly for students. However, some lessons are allowed to go up to 1.5 hours each, if absolutely necessary. 

This course should feel more like a coding bootcamp, as it is neither easy nor excessively difficult. It presumes that students have no knowledge of coding or development whatsoever, and begins from that assumption. It also assumes that students are not expecting this course to be easy, and that they are dedicated to learning Web3 development. The skills taught in the course cover a very broad range of topics, and almost every week produces at least one project that can be displayed in a portfolio or repository.

The lessons are divided into two sessions: Morning, and afternoon. For the first 6 weeks, the morning sessions are based on UI-heavy topics and modern web development, while the afternoon sessions are based on programming-heavy topics. Then, starting in Week 7 onward, these roles are reversed where the morning sessions cover Web3 topics, and the afternoon sessions cover UI and dApp-building.

Week 12 is reserved as a potential overflow or finishing up week, but if we don't need it for that purpose then we can dedicate it to building the NFT Chat Forum project. We may try to squeeze this project into earlier weeks, but we couldn't find an easy way to fit it into the content neatly.

This week is dedicated to showing how things used to be before the creation of frameworks like Tailwind and React, and students are encouraged to take the time to get caught up, practice basic skills, or take a breather--but they can also follow along and learn these systems in case they find an opportunity that requires them.
