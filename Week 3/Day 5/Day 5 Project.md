## Day 5 Project: Quiz App
### Skills:
* React basics: Understanding of React components, JSX, and how to use the create-react-app tool to set up a new React project.

* State management: Knowledge of how to use the useState hook to manage component state and update it as needed (e.g., for tracking the user's score, the current question, and the user's answer selections).

* Conditional rendering: Ability to render components or content based on certain conditions, such as displaying the final result when the quiz is complete or showing a 'Next Question' button only when a user has selected an answer.

* Event handling: Familiarity with handling user interactions, such as clicking buttons to submit answers, navigating to the next question, or restarting the quiz.

* Working with data: Knowing how to store the quiz questions and answers, either as a JavaScript object/array or by fetching them from an external API.

* Component composition: Understanding how to break down the application into smaller, reusable components (e.g., Question, AnswerOption, Result) and how to pass data and event handlers as props between these components.

* CSS and styling: Basic knowledge of CSS and how to apply styles to the components, either using inline styles, CSS modules, or styled-components.
