Week 2: JavaScript

Day 1: JavaScript Fundamentals

*Web Development V: JavaScript (10 minutes)*
 * What is JavaScript?
   * JavaScript's role in web development
 * How JavaScript differs from Python
   * Syntax
     * Curly braces and semicolons
     * Loop structure syntax
     * Variable declaration syntax
   * Application Context
     * JavaScript is run in the browser or on a server via Node.js 
     * Python is run on a machine, and can be used for server-side scripting, scientific computing, and even AI
     * Python is focused on scientific computing, data analysis, web development, and machine learning--among other topics
     * JavaScript is almost exclusively focused on web development and front-end design
   * Programming Paradigm
     * Python is heavily focused on Object Oriented Programming principles and is easier to learn
     * JavaScript uses Object Oriented Programming, but is less rigid and more difficult to grasp

*JavaScript I: Data Types, Variables, Functions, Arithmetic (15 minutes)*
 * Data Types:
   * Numbers
   * Strings
   * Booleans
 * Variables:
   * Function-Scoped Variables: var
     * Why we don't use var anymore
   * Block-Scoped Variables: let
     * Just use let for all variables
   * Constants: const
 * Arithmetic Operators:
   * Addition/Subtraction: +, -
   * Increment/Decrement: ++, --
   * Multiplication/Exponentiation: *, **
     * Alternative to exponents for older browsers: Math.pow(x, y)
   * Division/Modulo: /, %
     * JavaScript does not have a native integer division operator
	 * Math.floor(x / y) performs integer division by rounding result down
   * Parantheses: ()
   * Compound Assignment Operators: +=, -=, *=, /=
 * Functions:
   * Function Declaration
     * function myFunction(param1, param2, ...) {}
   * Function Expression
     * let myFunction = function(param1, param2, ...) {}
   * Arrow Functions
     * let myFunction = (param1, param2, ...) => {}
     * let myFunction = (param1, param2, ...) => param1 + param2;
	 * Arrow functions are used the most in this course

```
JS Lab: Hello World, Calculator, Parity Check (10 minutes)
  * Creating a "Hello World" program in JS
  * Writing a simple calculator program's functions in JS
  * Implementing a parity check function in JS
```
