Day 4: JavaScript: DOM Manipulation and React Practice





LESSON PROMPTS
* Alright, I think that will do it for Day 3, so let's move on to Day 4 now. Our first lesson for Day 4 is "DOM Manipulation and Event Handling with Vanilla JavaScript". Create a Lesson Objectives section for today's lesson.

* Very nice, now let's create an Introduction section for the lesson to explain why DOM manipulation and event handling is important.

* Great! Let's create a basic React JS app that we can use to practice event handling and DOM manipulation for today's lesson.

* Good, now let's get started with the lesson subjects. We will begin with the section titled "Manipulating the DOM with plain JavaScript: adding, removing, and modifying elements".

* Great! Now let's create the section "Event handling with plain JavaScript: event delegation, binding, and unbinding".

* Awesome, let's create the last section for this half of today's lesson, "User interaction: handling keyboard and mouse events".

* Finally, let's create a Lesson Summary for this part of the lesson. 

* Alright, let's do something different now and create a pop-quiz for students to take. This quiz will be written entirely in React, and will be copy-pasted and deployed from inside their terminal. It should have 10 multiple choice questions, and will tally up their scores once they've answered all the questions. It can be fairly simplistic and doesn't need much CSS styling. If you need to break it up into multiple pieces, then let me know so I can tell you to continue.

Nice work! Let's create each of the 10 questions and possible answers, for our questionData.js file now, and then we can move on to the next lesson!



Alright, now that we're done with the first part of today's lessons, let's work on the next part: "React Practice and Introduction to Form Validation". Create a Lesson Objectives section for this part of the lesson.

Excellent, let's write an Introduction section that explains what form validation is and how we can use JavaScript to perform it.

Good job! Let's begin the lesson with "More practice with React components and state management", by providing some review of React components and state management from yesterday.

That's good, let's create the section for "Introduction to form validation: client-side vs server-side validation". Explain the difference between these concepts, and the technologies that are usually involved in each one.

Excellent, let's now work on the section "React-based validation techniques: checking input values, displaying error messages". Provide some code samples that reflect any previous samples provided, which can show how React handles the same operations.

Alright, that will tie off today's lesson, so let's finish it with a Lesson Summary. Then, we will need to create 5 exercises for adding form validation to a React component that the students can work on.
