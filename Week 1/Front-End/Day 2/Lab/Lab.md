# W1D2 Lab

Alright everyone. Here is our lab for today. 

You can see the layout on the example. We need a header, main, and footer section. The header has an h1 element with the text Contact Form...

Inside the main element is where this form you see will go. Make sure to wrap the form in a new div.  

Make sure the First Name, Last Name, Email, and Comment sections are required.

You need to send the form to action_url.php with a POST method.

You can pick what you want for name, id, value (where needed), etc.

Make sure the for label attribute matches the name for the elements...

Remember we want to be able to click not just the checkbox or radio button but also the labels as well to select the checkboxes or radio buttons.

Finally submit and reset buttons.

We want a horizontal rule after the end of the header element and right before the beginning of the footer element.

We want the footer to contain the text 'Copyright 2023'.

So, that's all I'm gonna give you and it is up to you to work through and recreate the form I have for you there.
