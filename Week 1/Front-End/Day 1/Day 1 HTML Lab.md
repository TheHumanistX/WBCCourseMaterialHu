# Day 1: Intro to HTML Lab

Now that you've learned about the basic structure of an HTML document and how to use common HTML tags, it's time to put that knowledge into practice. 

In this activity, you'll create a simple webpage using the tags we've covered in this lesson.

* Start by creating a new HTML file in your text editor and setting up the base structure (remember the `<!DOCTYPE>`, ``<html>``, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements).
* Add a title to your webpage by using the `<title>` tag within the `<head>` element.
* Inside the `<body>` element, create paragraphs using the `<p>` tag.
* Add ordered and unordered lists using the `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<li>` tags.
* Format some of the text using non-semantic text tags like `<b>`, `<i>`, and `<u>`.
* Include an image using the `<img>` tag, making sure to provide a proper src attribute and alt text.
* Create hyperlinks using the `<a>` tag to link to external websites, internal pages, and email addresses.
* Build a table using the `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` tags to display data in a structured format.

As you work on your webpage, I'll be walking around the classroom to assist and answer any questions you may have. Don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification if you need it. Good luck, and have fun creating your webpage!
