* Next, create a header with the name of a recipe, a list of ingredients using an unordered list, a list of instructions, in italics, using ordered lists, and a photo of the finished dish using the image element. Be sure to apply the alt text to the image for accessibilty. Align everything to the center of the page.

* Create a table that displays a list of three animals, their classification, and habitat. The table should have three columns, with headings for each column, and three rows of data.  The column headings need to be underlined and separate from the table body. Center the entire table and also center the text inside the table cells.
* Use a two line breaks to create some white space below the animals section 
* Create a table that will display a schedule for a day with multiple events. The table should have three columns (Time, Event, Location) and multiple rows. The cells in the time column should all be a single row.Merge cells in the "Event"/"Location" columns to show that some events occur across multiple time slots (just like a modern calendar app).  Have 8 hours (8 rows) of time and 4 events/locations across those 8 hours that fill that 8 hour range.

* Using the text: 'Return to the top of the page'.  Create an anchor tag with the href element that returns the user to the top of the page when they click it.  Also, name this element 'bottom' and create another anchor/href tag at the very top of the page that sends the user to the bottom of the page when clicked.
