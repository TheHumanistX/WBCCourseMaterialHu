# W1D1 Lab

Hey everyone! Alright, so we are here with our first Lab section! 

I'm going to show you a webpage I already have made and quickly run down the items on the page. I also have a text version of the Lab requirements so you can just watch the video and not worry about writing anything down.

We are creating a personal webpage to say some things about us.

We need a title heading (as in the largest heading) at the top that is centered. That will be your Discord name.

Next we have an 'About Me:' section. We want the 'About Me' to be a heading that is a little smaller.

Next we have a paragraph where you need to just input some text that tells us some about you, about why you joined the course, etc. 

Below that we have another smaller heading with the text 'Goals For The Course'.

Under that, create an ordered list that has three list items. Those are three goals you have for yourself in this course.

Next will be another heading titled 'Contact Info:'
You will create an unordered list underneath that and put maybe your email and another contact like your Discord username or Twitter account or something like that.  These both need to be hyperlinks!

For the next section, you will be sharing with us your three favorite movies. You will need to go and find images of the cover/poster of each of those movies.

Create the heading 'Top 3 Movies:' and make sure it is centered.

Underneath that insert the three images so they are stacked vertically.

Now, here's the extra little trick. We want each of these images to be a link to each movie's IMDB page.  

So, when you click one of the movie poster images, it will take you to that movie's IMDB page.

Below this you will create two tables, both centered in the page.

The first table will have one header cell that spans all the columns in the table body. The border for the table will be set to "1".
The table body will have two rows with four cells each.

The first row's cells will show Bold Text, Italic Text, Underlined Text, Strikethrough text.

The second row's cells will show Strong Text, Emphasized Text, Subscript Text, and Superscript Text.

Next, the second table will be telling us your top 3 favorite TV Shows and Books.

The header for this table will span two columns.

The table will have 6 rows.

The first row will have two cells. The first cell will say "TV Shows" and that cell needs to cover three rows.

The next two rows just have one cell each.  In the second cell of the first row and the single cells of the next two rows you will enter your top 3 favorite TV shows.

Now, in the fourth row, you will again have two cells.  The first cell will say "Books" and cover three rows.

The next two rows again have just one sell.

In the second cell of the fourth row and the single cell in the fifth and sixth rows, enter you top three favorite books.

Lastly, at the bottom of the page create a link back to the top of the page. Then, also, at the top of the page, create a link back down to that link at the bottom of the page.

That covers is! You can look at my page for reference and remember I also laid this out in text form for you all AND you have your HTML I cheatsheet to refer to as well!

Good luck! Ask questions in the Discord if you have any!
