# Week 1 - Day 1 - Lab Requirements:

* Create your base html boilerplate code. Your main tags needed to start off any website. 
  * This will be a basic personal website that has your name (discord name) centered as the main heading at the to of the page.  
* Below that will be an About Me: section. About Me will be two headings smaller than your name. You will have a new paragraph element underneath that with a brief introduction about yourself.
* Use a line break to split the text into two paragraphs visually.
* Below this you will have your Goals For The Course. This section label is the same size as the above label. This will be an ordered list that lists your top 3 goals for the course. 
Next is Contact Info: Same heading size as previous heading.  You can list whatever contact information you want here. Email, Discord, Twitter, Telegram, etc.
* You will now create a centered heading (same size as previous heading) that is titled: Top 3 Movies:
* You will create three image elements (don't forget alt text). You will need to go to IMDB or Google and get a link to an image of either the movie cover or poster for each of your top 3 movies. Have them stack verically. Don't let them end up next to each other.
* We will now create two tables. 
    * For the first, You need a table with border of 1, it needs a table header and table body. The table header needs to span 4 columns and be titled "My First Table".
        * The table body will have 2 rows with 4 cells in each row.
        * The first row's cells will have the following text in them, "Bold Text",	"Italic Text", "Underlined Text",	"Strikethrough Text".
        * The second row's cells will have the same text in each cell BUT you need to style each cell's text accordingly.
    * Insert a line break after this table.
  * Your next table also has a border of 1. It has a table header and a table body.  
    * The table header needs to span 2 columns.
    * The table body will consist of 6 rows. 
    * The first and fourth rows will have two cells with the first of each of these rows spanning 3 columns.
    * The other rows have one cell.
    * The first cell (that spans 3 columns) in the first row has the text "TV Shows".
    * The first cell (that spans 3 columns) in the fourth row has the text "Books".
    * In the second cell in the first row and the single cell in the second and third rows, list your top 3 TV Shows.
    * In the second cell in the fourth row and the single cell in the second and third rows, list your top 3 Books.
* At the bottom of this page, create a anchor tag with an href element that links to the top of the page and has the text "Back to Top". Also, name this anchor tag "bottom". Make this an h2 element as well so the text is larger.
* At the very top of the page, create an anchor tag that links to the 'bottom' anchor element and use the text "To Bottom Of Page" for the link. Also an h2.
