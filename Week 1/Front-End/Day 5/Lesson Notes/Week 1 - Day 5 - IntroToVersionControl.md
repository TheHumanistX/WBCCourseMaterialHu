# Git/Github: Intro to Version Control


## What is version control?

* Version control: A system that allows you to track changes made to files over time, making it easier to collaborate, track progress, and revert to earlier versions when needed.
    * Types of version control systems: Centralized (e.g., Subversion) and distributed (e.g., Git). Centralized systems have a single, central repository, while distributed systems have multiple repositories that can be synced with each other.
    * Advantages of version control:
        * Collaboration: Multiple team members can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts, using features like branching and merging.
        * History: Track changes to the codebase, including who made the changes, when, and why (using commit messages).
        * Backup and recovery: Easily revert to previous versions if a bug is introduced or a mistake is made, reducing the risk of data loss.
        * Experimentation: Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes, allowing you to experiment without affecting the main codebase.

## Use of Git/Github in professional development

* Git: A popular distributed version control system, designed for speed, efficiency, and handling large projects. Created by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system.
* Github: A web-based platform for Git repositories, providing a user-friendly interface, collaboration tools, and additional features like issue tracking, project management, and continuous integration.

## Importance in professional development:

* Collaboration: Share code and work on projects with other developers using pull requests and code reviews.
* Showcase: Display your coding skills and projects to potential employers, demonstrating your ability to work with version control systems and collaborate effectively.
* Networking: Connect with other developers, contribute to open-source projects, and learn from the community.
* Learning: Explore and study code from other developers, enhancing your knowledge and skills.

## Creating a Github account

* Visit https://github.com and click "Sign up."
* Provide a username, email address, and password. Choose a unique username that represents you or your projects.
* Complete the account setup process, including email verification, selecting a plan (free or paid), and completing a short survey about your experience and interests.
* Customize your profile by adding a profile picture, bio, and other personal information.

## Installing Git

* Windows: Download the Git installer from https://git-scm.com/download/win and follow the installation instructions. Choose options that best suit your needs during the installation process.
* macOS: Use Homebrew (https://brew.sh) to install Git by running brew install git in the terminal. Alternatively, download the installer from https://git-scm.com/download/mac and follow the installation instructions.
* Linux: Install Git using the package manager for your distribution (e.g., sudo apt-get install git for Debian-based systems, sudo yum install git for Red Hat-based systems). Check the Git documentation for specific installation instructions for your distribution.
