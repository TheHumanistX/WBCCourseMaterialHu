# Classes and Objects Exercises
## 1. Creating Classes with Attributes, `__init__`, and self

1.1. Create a class called `Person` with attributes `name`, `age`, and `gender`. Use the `__init__` constructor function and the `self` keyword to initialize these attributes.

1.2. Create a class called `Car` with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. Use the `__init__` constructor function and the `self` keyword to initialize these attributes.

1.3. Create a class called `Book` with attributes `title`, `author`, and `publication_year`. Use the `__init__` constructor function and the `self` keyword to initialize these attributes.

1.4. Create a class called `Product` with attributes `name`, `price`, and `category`. Use the `__init__` constructor function and the `self` keyword to initialize these attributes.

1.5. Create a class called `City` with attributes `name`, `country`, and `population`. Use the `__init__` constructor function and the `self` keyword to initialize these attributes.

## 2. Adding Methods to Classes

2.1. Add a method called `say_hello` to the `Person` class that prints a message saying `"Hello, my name is {name}!"`.

2.2. Add a method called `car_info` to the `Car` class that prints the `make`, `model`, and `year` of the car in a single line.

2.3. Add a method called `get_age` to the `Book` class that returns the `age` of the book in years, based on the current year (assume the current year is 2023).

2.4. Add a method called `apply_discount` to the `Product` class that takes a `discount_percentage` as an argument and applies it to the `price` of the product.

2.5. Add a method called `increase_population` to the `City` class that takes a `number` as an argument and increases the city's population by that amount.

## 3. Creating Objects from Classes

3.1. Create a `Person` object with the name "Alice", age 30, and gender "female". Print the object's attributes.

3.2. Create a `Car` object with the make "Toyota", model "Camry", and year 2020. Print the object's attributes.

3.3. Create a `Book` object with the title "To Kill a Mockingbird", author "Harper Lee", and publication year 1960. Print the object's attributes.

3.4. Create a `Product` object with the name "Laptop", price 1200, and category "Electronics". Print the object's attributes.

3.5. Create a `City` object with the name "Paris", country "France", and population 2,140,526. Print the object's attributes.

## 4. Modifying Object Attributes

4.1. Modify the `Person` object's name to "Alicia" and print the updated name.

4.2. Modify the `Car` object's year to 2021 and print the updated year.

4.3. Modify the `Book` object's publication year to 1961 and print the updated publication year.

4.4. Modify the `Product` object's price to 1000 and print the updated price.

4.5. Modify the `City` object's population to 2,150,000 and print the updated population.
