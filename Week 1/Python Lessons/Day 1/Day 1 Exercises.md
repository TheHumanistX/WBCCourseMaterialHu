# Day 1 Unguided Exercises
### Intro
These **optional** exercises are provided so you can practice the topics that you found most challenging to understand. If you can read the description of the exercise and *immediately* know how to code it, then you probably don't need to do it!

While many of these exercises are easy, some of them are more challenging and require some thinking and experimentation to solve. 

These exercises don't have a solutions document, as they are quite easy to work with.

### Input and Output
Given a simple description, use `input()`, `print()`, variable assignments, and simple arithmetic to write a program that meets the description:
1. Ask the user to enter their name and print a message that greets them.
1. Prompt the user to enter their age and then print out a message that tells them how many years until they turn 100.
1. Ask the user to enter their favorite color and then print a message that says "Your favorite color is {color}".
1. Request the user to enter a number and then print out the number multiplied by 5.
1. Ask the user to input their hometown and then print a message that says "You are from {hometown}".
1. Prompt the user to enter their email address and print a message that says "Your email is {email}".
1. Ask the user to enter a number, and then print the square of that number.
1. Request the user to enter their favorite food and then print a message that says "Your favorite food is {food}".
1. Ask the user to enter a string, and then print out the length of that string (Use `len()`).
1. Prompt the user to enter their phone number and then print a message that says "Your phone number is {phone number}".

### Variables and Arithmetic
The first five exercises will test your ability to declare variables, assign values, and use simple arithmetic operators on them. The last five will test your ability to store a user's input in a variable and perform incrementing or decrementing operations on it.

1. Define two variables, x and y, and assign them the values 3 and 7, respectively. Create a new variable result and assign it the value of x multiplied by y plus 2.

1. Define three variables, a, b, and c, and assign them the values 4, 6, and 8, respectively. Create a new variable total and assign it the value of a plus b minus c.

1. Define two variables, m and n, and assign them the values 12 and 5, respectively. Create a new variable calc and assign it the value of m divided by n plus m minus n.

1. Define three variables, p, q, and r, and assign them the values 2, 5, and 7, respectively. Create a new variable result and assign it the value of p multiplied by q plus r divided by p.

1. Define two variables, s and t, and assign them the values 10 and 3, respectively. Create a new variable result and assign it the value of s divided by t minus s plus t.

1. Create a program that asks the user for an integer and stores it in a variable. Then, increment the variable by 1 and print the new value to the console.

1. Create a program that asks the user for a float and stores it in a variable. Then, decrement the variable by 0.5 and print the new value to the console.

1. Create a program that defines a variable with an initial value of 10. Then, increment the variable by 2 times itself and print the new value to the console.

1. Create a program that defines a variable with an initial value of 100. Then, decrement the variable by itself divided by 10 and print the new value to the console.

1. Create a program that asks the user for two integers and stores them in separate variables. Then, increment both variables by 1, multiply them together, and print the new values to the console.

### Strings: Uppercase, Lowercase, Title Case
The following exercises use the `upper()`, `lower()`, and `title()` string methods. These functions are accessed by "dot notation", such as `some_string.upper()`, `some_string.lower()`, and `some_string.title()`. The `upper()` method will turn all letters in the string into uppercase letters, the `lower()` method will turn all letters into lowercase, and `title()` will turn every first letter into an uppercase letter.

We did not officially learn these methods in today's lesson, but there are many methods and functions throughout Python that you can discover and use without being taught how to use them in a lesson.

1. Ask the user to enter their name in lowercase letters. Use the `title()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word and then print the new string.

1. Create a string variable with the value `"HELLO WORLD"`. Use the `lower()` method to convert the string to lowercase and then print the new string.

1. Ask the user to enter a sentence in uppercase letters. Use the `lower()` method to convert the string to lowercase and then print the new string.

1. Create a string variable with the value `"the quick brown fox"`. Use the `upper()` method to convert the string to uppercase and then print the new string.

1. Ask the user to enter their name in uppercase letters. Use the `lower()` method to convert the string to lowercase and then use the `title()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word. Finally, print the new string.

1. Create a string variable with the value `"i like programming"`. Use the `title()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word and then print the new string.

1. Ask the user to enter a sentence in lowercase letters. Use the `title()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word and then print the new string.

1. Create a string variable with the value `"PYTHON IS COOL"`. Use the `lower()` method to convert the string to lowercase and then use the `title()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word. Finally, print the new string.

1. Ask the user to enter a sentence. Use the `upper()` method to convert the string to uppercase and then print the new string.

1. Create a string variable with the value `"hello, world!"`. Use the `title()` method to capitalize the first letter of each word and then print the new string.

### Type Conversion
These exercises practice your type conversion abilities. You will need to recognize which data type you need to convert to in order for the program to work, and you will sometimes need to perform multiple type conversions.

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter two decimal numbers and then prints out their product. Input: `2.5`, `10.5` Output: `26.25`

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter two integers, multiplies them together, and then prints out the number of digits in the final result. Input: `15`, `25` Output: `3`

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, concatenates `500` onto the end, then returns the result of dividing the number in half. Input: `500`, Output: `250250`

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a decimal number and then prints out the rounded integer value of that number.

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a decimal number and then prints out the decimal portion of that number. **Hint:** Use type conversion and subtraction.


### Math-To-Code Exercises (Easy)
Convert each of the following 5 simple math formulas into code. Then, test them with the values `x = 5`, `y = 10`, `z = 3.5`, and see if you get the same result. Don't forget: Two variables side-by-side are implied multiplication!

#### 1. $(x + y)z$
##### Result: 4.6875

#### 2. $x / (y - z)$
##### Result: 0.7352941176470589

#### 3. $(xy) - z$

#### 4. $(x - y) / z$
##### Result: -1.5625

#### 5. $(xy) + (xz) + (yz)$
##### Result: 98.0
