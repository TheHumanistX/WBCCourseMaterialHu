**Algorithm:** A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing a task, often used in the context of computer programming and problem-solving.

**API (Application Programming Interface):** A set of rules, protocols, and tools for building software applications, allowing different software components to communicate with each other.

**Array:** A data structure that holds a collection of elements, each identified by an index or a key.

**Callback function:** A function passed as an argument to another function, which is then called (or executed) within that function at a later point in time.

**Compiler:** A software tool that translates code written in a high-level programming language (e.g., C++, Java) into machine code or bytecode that can be executed by a computer.

**Conditional statement:** A statement that allows a program to make decisions based on whether a certain condition is true or false (e.g., if, else, elif statements).

**Data type:** A classification that specifies the type of value a variable can hold, such as integers, floating-point numbers, strings, or booleans.

**Encapsulation:** The practice of bundling data (variables) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit or class, hiding the internal implementation details from the outside world.

**Exception:** An event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts its normal flow, usually due to an error or an unexpected condition.

**Function:** A reusable piece of code that performs a specific task, accepts input in the form of arguments, and may return a value.

**Garbage collection:** An automatic memory management technique in programming languages that identifies and frees up memory that is no longer in use by a program.

**Inheritance:** In object-oriented programming, a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and modularity.

**Loop:** A control structure that repeatedly executes a block of code until a certain condition is met or while a specific condition is true.

**Null:** A special value that represents the absence of a value or the intentional assignment of no value to a variable.

**Object:** In object-oriented programming, an instance of a class that represents a real-world entity, having properties (data) and methods (functions) that can be used to interact with the object.

**Operand:** An operand is a value or a variable on which an operator acts in an expression. Operands are the inputs to an operation represented by an operator.

**Operator:** In programming, an operator is a symbol or a keyword that represents a specific operation or action to be performed on one or more values, called operands. Operators are used in expressions to manipulate data and perform calculations.

**Polymorphism:** A feature in object-oriented programming that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling the same method to be used on different types of objects.

**Recursion:** A programming technique where a function calls itself as a subroutine, allowing problems to be solved by breaking them into smaller, more manageable tasks.

**Scope:** The area of a program where a variable is accessible and visible, typically defined by the context in which the variable is declared (e.g., global or local scope).

**Syntax:** The set of rules that define how programs written in a programming language should be structured and formatted.

**Variable:** A storage location in a computer's memory that holds a value, which can be changed during program execution.
