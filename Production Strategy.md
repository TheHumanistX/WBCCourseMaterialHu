# Project Production Strategy

## Project: Whiteboard Crypto Web3 Portfolio Builder Bootcamp
## Objectives:
  - To teach people who have never touched programming or web development how to build web apps and Web3 dApps.
  - To teach the fundamentals of programming, web design, development, and web applications using the React JS and Tailwind CSS frameworks. 
  - To teach the fundamentals of blockchain technology, blockchain assets, Ethereum and the EVM, Solidity smart contracts, and how Web3 decentralized applications work. 
  - To create a portfolio of Web3 dApps, programming projects, and web apps

## Begin Date: March 27, 2023
## End Date: June 19, 2023

## Production Strategy: Agile Development Model -- Phases repeat every 1-2 weeks
  **Planning and Requirements Gathering: Beginning of project**
  ***DONE*** Create weekly topics and projects document -- See "Weekly Syllabus Overview.md"

  **Design: When there does not exist a production schedule for a week**
  1. Divide weekly topics into lesson topics and sub-topics
    - Sub-topics should be discrete from each other, but may easily lead into each other
      - Topic Examples: Intro to CSS, Control Structures
      - Sub-Topic Example: Selectors, While Loops
    - Do not include any more detail than is needed to remember what each topic/sub-topic is, as this will come later

  2. Organize weekly projects into base components that *can* be completed at different times (but don't necessarily need to be)
    - This will help us to leverage modularity in the topics, which we can use for rebalancing the topics if needed
    - Most lecture topics will constitute one component, but multi-file projects will likely require multiple components
    - Basic HTML Tags will be one component, but HTML Forms and Inputs may be another component, and CSS Selectors and Attributes could be another

  3. Assign estimated timeframes *students* will spend on each topic and project component 
    - Example: Basic HTML Tags - 10m, Variables - 5m, Classes and Objects - 10m, Progamming Fundamentals Lab - 30m, Website Landing Page w/ CSS (Part 1) - 45m

  4. Arrange all topics and project components across week to balance out student session time
    - Initially aim for 1 hour each session
    - It is okay to go over or under, we will rebalance as we produce content

  5. Break daily lesson topics into production components
    - These are deliverables that need to be designed and produced, and will consume an amount of time to produce
    - Examples of component types we may have: Video Presentation, Screen-Capture Session, Lesson Text, Diagrams, Practice Problems, Cheat Sheets, Project/Challenge Guides

  6. Organize production components into a production schedule, assigning a size to each: Small, Medium, Large, Async
    - Small components have no dependencies and can be quickly produced, such as lesson text
    - Medium components will require more time to produce, and may have dependencies with existing components, such as diagrams
    - Large components are time-consuming and difficult to produce, particularly video files and full-scale projects
    - Async components are components that can't be created in one sitting, such as project guides

  **Development: For each component in the production schedule**
  1. Choose a component from the production schedule

  2. Write any notes needed to aid in production
    - This can include slide notes, project criteria, or brainstormed ideas

  3. Produce component
    - This phase will take variable amounts of time based on component complexity
        - Video production always includes production of video materials (slideshow illustrations and finished lesson code), and editing
        - If more than one component is discovered, then create a smaller production schedule to keep them organized
    - It is okay to stop production if you discover a hidden dependency on another component in the production schedule
        - If this happens, then note the dependency in the production schedule and begin development on another component

  **Testing: When a component has been developed and needs final testing and polishing**
  1. Examine and review component for flaws or inconsistencies
    - Note any non-immediate flaws in the production schedule, we will circle back to them if time permits
    - This would include testing all code components one final time before declaring them finished

  2. Correct any immediate flaws in component, and repeat testing phase

  3. For non-immediate flaws, get second opinion about whether to correct them or not

  **Deployment and Maintenance**
  - Once component has been developed and tested, mark it as **COMPLETE** in the production schedule.
  - Go back to **Development** phase and pick the next component
